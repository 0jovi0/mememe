# **MEmeme Launchpad**

## üöÄ **Launch, Auction, and Trade Meme Coins in a Single Call**

**MEmeme Launchpad** is the ultimate solution for launching meme coins securely and efficiently. Built as a **Uniswap V4 hook**, MEmeme not only enables single-contract deployment for token launches but also creates a liquidity pool at Uniswap that transitions seamlessly from auction to long-term trading.

---

### **The Problem**

Launching meme coins today is complicated and inefficient:

1. **Multiple Contracts**: Token creation, auction management, and trading often require separate deployments, increasing costs.
2. **Temporary Auction Pools**: Many launchpads create temporary liquidity setups that need to be replaced post-auction.
3. **Trust Issues**: Platforms frequently rely on unverified or unproven mechanisms, leaving creators and traders vulnerable.

### **The Solution**

With **MEmeme**, you get a streamlined and trustless system:

1. **Unified Pool Lifecycle**:
    - The Uniswap V4 pool used for the auction automatically becomes the AMM for long-term trading.
    - No need to migrate liquidity or create a new pool post-auction.
2. **Single Contract Call**:
    - Create a token, deploy a Uniswap V4 pool, and start the auction in one transaction.
3. **Hooks-Enforced Security**:
    - Hooks manage swap and liquidity behaviors for predictable and safe auction phases.

### **Key Features**

1. **üí∞ Seamless Token Deployment**
    
    - Define token parameters (supply, allocation, name, symbol, price).
    - Deploy everything in a single call via the `HookMonolith` contract.
2. **üéØ Integrated Auction and Trading**
    
    - **Auction Phase**:
        - The Uniswap V4 pool operates as a restricted auction market.
        - Buyers can acquire tokens directly from the pool during **Period Zero**.
    - **Post-Auction Trading**:
        - After the auction ends, the same pool transitions to **Period One** - when it becomes a decentralized AMM for MEME token trading.
3. **‚ö° Powered by Uniswap V4 Hooks**
    
    - Leverages Uniswap‚Äôs battle-tested AMM for safe and reliable market making.
    - Hooks enforce restricted behaviors during the auction and allow free market operations after.
4. **üîí Trustless, Efficient Design**
    
    - No need for separate auction and trading contracts.
    - Eliminates migration risks and inefficiencies.
5. **üìä Developer-Friendly Architecture**
    
    - Fully integrated token launch and trading lifecycle.
    - Modular design for easy customization. (In the future)

### **How It Works**

1. **Token Deployment**:
    
    - Call the `HookMonolith` contract with token details, including the desired auction price.
2. **Auction Phase** (**Period Zero**):
    
    - The Uniswap V4 pool serves as the auction platform.
    - Buyers acquire tokens through swaps (USDT ‚Üí MEME token).
    - Liquidity and token allocations remain locked during this phase.
3. **Transition to Trading** (**Period One**):
    
    - After 48 hours, the auction concludes:
        - Remaining tokens are burned.
        - Liquidity becomes fully accessible for trading.
    - The same Uniswap V4 pool transitions seamlessly into an AMM for MEME token trading.
4. **Post-Auction Trading**:
    
    - Users freely trade MEME tokens in the same pool that hosted the auction.
