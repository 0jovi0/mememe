### **Development Workflow**

#### **Step 1: ERC20 Token Development**

- Implement token creation with:
    - `totalSupply`, `allocatedAmount`, `name`, `symbol` parameters.
    - Minting the total supply during deployment.
- Transfer total supply minus allocated tokens to the HookMonolith.
- Lock the creatorâ€™s allocated tokens until the end of **Period Zero**.

#### **Step 2: HookMonolith Implementation**

- Deploy ERC20 tokens.
- Deploy Uniswap v4 pool:
    - Initialize with user-defined price range.
    - Provide liquidity: `totalSupply - allocatedAmount`.
- Implement auction control flow:
    - **Period Zero**:
        - Restrict swaps and liquidity changes using hooks.
    - **Transition to Period One**:
        - Remove liquidity, deduct developer fee, unlock tokens, and burn remaining tokens.
    - **Period One**:
        - Enable free market operations with custom fees on swaps.

#### **Step 3: Hook Functionality**

- Implement `beforeSwapHook`, `afterSwapHook`, and liquidity hooks to enforce behavior during each period.

#### **Step 4: Testing**

- Test all functionality with different scenarios:
    - Auction initialization and period transitions.
    - Restriction enforcement during **Period Zero**.
    - Free market operations and fee deductions in **Period One**.

#### **Step 5: Deployment**

- Deploy on a test network for final testing.
- Ensure hooks are functioning as expected across both periods.
